On this page, all except the first 21 emojis are displayed in a way that uses lazy loading of the images. These images are contained in &lt;li class=&quot;lazyparent&quot;&gt; elements. Assuming that there are no other &lt;li class=&quot;lazyparent&quot;&gt; elements on the page, we should get the number of emojis on iOS simply by counting those elements.<p>Opening up the console and running<p><pre><code>  document.getElementsByClassName(&#x27;lazyparent&#x27;).length\n</code></pre>\ngives us 4037. So the total number of emojis on iOS should be 4037 + 21 = 4058. If the above method is correct, that is.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emojipedia.org&#x2F;apple&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emojipedia.org&#x2F;apple&#x2F;</a>', 'time': 1665909284, 'type': 'comment'}

Server rendered pages&#x2F;fragments solve so many issues around security and time to develop a product, however it only gets you so far.<p>Ultimately I think the decision when choosing a stack comes down to how much state you need to managed in browser. The vast majority of sites needs very little client side state management, htmx and other tools such as Alpine.js are perfect for this. But eventually as you reach a more “app like” experience with multiple layers of state control on the front end you need to reach for a front end JS framework.<p>Now that doesn’t always mean going all in on a full SPA covering the whole of your product. It could just be a small fragment that requires that level of interaction.<p>Point is, don’t pick a tool because it’s “in vogue”, pick one because it lets you build the best possible product as efficiently as possible. For 80% of websites that could be htmx, and for the next 15% htmx probably works for 90% of their pages. It’s the 5% where htmx is not one of the right choices at all.', 'time': 1665872055, 'type': 'comment'}

Also the API boundaries are blurred should you ever need one for non UI usage. Ignoring HackerNews taste for simpler websites, some complexity of UIs can and should only be captured with client sided javascript.<p>With that said, after a few years of things shifting around I&#x27;m really happy with the Typescript (lang) + Parcel (packaging) + MobX (state management) + Vercel (when server side rendering is needed). They&#x27;ve been really stable, no fuss, always work. Especially MobX for state, absolutely game changing for the dev experience.<p>As for the data binding problem, still sucks and my 4th attempt at solving it internally is still meh.

After seeing this, I can&#x27;t be the only one who got curious as to how many emojis there actually are on iOS.<p>Obviously, a quick google doesn&#x27;t work right now.<p>So I did this to try to figure out: emojipedia.org, the site that supposedly breaks google, has a page that appears to show all the available emojis on iOS [1]. On this page, all except the first 21 emojis are displayed in a way that uses lazy loading of the images. These images are contained in &lt;li class=&quot;lazyparent&quot;&gt; elements. Assuming that there are no other &lt;li class=&quot;lazyparent&quot;&gt; elements on the page, we should get the number of emojis on iOS simply by counting those elements.<p>Opening up the console and running<p><pre><code>  document.getElementsByClassName(&#x27;lazyparent&#x27;).length
</code></pre>
gives us 4037. So the total number of emojis on iOS should be 4037 + 21 = 4058. If the above method is correct, that is.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emojipedia.org&#x2F;apple&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emojipedia.org&#x2F;apple&#x2F;</a><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
I think my favorite part is that this is so outrageously unheard of that the error isn&#x27;t even CSS-styled correctly. Zero left margin, just up against the edge of the window. Nobody even thinks about this case of an error being displayed because it&#x27;s so rare.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
All I can think about is the poor oncall engineer waking up to a latency alarm on a saturday night.<br>

It was electrifying. Understand that by 1984 there were millions of Americans using computers with a command line interface. While they could all do game graphics, you always started out in text mode and had to learn incantations that are familiar to many users of this site but which are no longer a part of most users’ daily life: dir, cd, del, etc.<p>Seeing how dramatically different a computer experience could be was like opening a door to an alternate universe for people. The day after the Super Bowl in 1984 when their famous big Brother commercial ran, my girlfriend’s computer-illiterate father announced to us “I know how to use a computer now” and of course I knew exactly why.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
Credit to @Stammy on Twitter who shared this over there. Thought everyone here would find this pretty cool. I&#x27;m a sucker for this era of advertising. This is a particularly beautiful spread, and super cool to see a snapshot of that moment in time and how Apple was positioning this brand new product.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
I especially like what is being printed out:<p><i>In America, the &quot;Yuppies&quot; -- Young Urban Professionals -- are having babies at an unprecedented rate. And literally nothing is too good for these infants of the affluent. In fact, they&#x27;re called Gourmet Babies! So we propose to offer traditional Yuppie foods -- sushi, pasta salads, brie cheeses, etc. -- in baby food form.</i><p>That business model work work <i>today</i>. Say what you will about Apple, they really know their target demographic.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
The problem with Apple&#x27;s extensive advertising was that they ended up having to price the Mac higher than an individual could afford so they could cover the marketing budget. Combined with the lack of software and the small amount of (non-upgradable) RAM, this meant that Mac sales slumped after the initial rush of early adopters.

<br>Moving from React to htmx

Love htmx and this talk is a brilliant run down of where it works well.<p>But as always it’s about choosing the right tool for the job. Server rendered pages&#x2F;fragments solve so many issues around security and time to develop a product, however it only gets you so far.<p>Ultimately I think the decision when choosing a stack comes down to how much state you need to managed in browser. The vast majority of sites needs very little client side state management, htmx and other tools such as Alpine.js are perfect for this. But eventually as you reach a more “app like” experience with multiple layers of state control on the front end you need to reach for a front end JS framework.<p>Now that doesn’t always mean going all in on a full SPA covering the whole of your product. It could just be a small fragment that requires that level of interaction.<p>Point is, don’t pick a tool because it’s “in vogue”, pick one because it lets you build the best possible product as efficiently as possible. For 80% of websites that could be htmx, and for the next 15% htmx probably works for 90% of their pages. It’s the 5% where htmx is not one of the right choices at all.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
People forget that React can be used for just the complex components that require it.  Your entire page need not be a React app just because you use it for one component.<p>To me it&#x27;s bonkers that all web sites seem to be moving towards SPA when they don&#x27;t benefit from it at all and require so much frontend work when a little bit of simple HTML and Javascript could do most of the work. It feels like the whole industry is Reactifying everything because they&#x27;re scared that if they don&#x27;t they won&#x27;t look professional.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
Some years ago, a bright guy created something called 7 GUIs. It’s a collection of seven problems that all UI systems must successfully implement, and it was intended to act as a guide for comparisons.<p>Unfortunately I think the author has passed away, but it would be interesting to see it rekindled and used for baseline comparisons like these.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eugenkiss.github.io&#x2F;7guis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eugenkiss.github.io&#x2F;7guis&#x2F;</a><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
There are four main problems in the React SPA world:<p>- State management - hooks are awful for anything complex<p>- Packaging + Bundling - Webpack kitchen sink, JS&#x2F;TS, browser vs node vs random runtimes, packaging vs bundling, etc<p>- Data&#x2F;API binding - Adds distributed state to your data and the complexity that goes with that (cross dom reuse, caching, staleness, realtime updates, etc)<p>- SEO&#x2F;Prehydrating - Mostly applies to landing&#x2F;CRM&#x2F;blog type things.<p>These &#x27;old school&#x27; solutions help you avoid some of these issues in favor of relocating the complexity a bit (those templates in the talk are absolutely gnarly and I&#x27;m sure very bug prone) and reducing the experience. Also the API boundaries are blurred should you ever need one for non UI usage. Ignoring HackerNews taste for simpler websites, some complexity of UIs can and should only be captured with client sided javascript.<p>With that said, after a few years of things shifting around I&#x27;m really happy with the Typescript (lang) + Parcel (packaging) + MobX (state management) + Vercel (when server side rendering is needed). They&#x27;ve been really stable, no fuss, always work. Especially MobX for state, absolutely game changing for the dev experience.<p>As for the data binding problem, still sucks and my 4th attempt at solving it internally is still meh. This feels like it comes with the territory.<p>As much as I loved my working with Django&#x2F;Jinja2&#x2F;etc, I think theres a light at  the end of this tunnel.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
Htmx is great for developers who need client side interactivity, but would rather not write any js. If you don&#x27;t mind writing a bit of js however, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Preact. Same api as React, but at a fraction of react-dom&#x27;s bundle size. It looks like the minified source is even smaller than htmx (which is already very minimal) [1][2]. They&#x27;ve also packaged Preact in such a way that you don&#x27;t need to add a build step to use it [3].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unpkg.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;htmx.org@1.8.2&#x2F;dist&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unpkg.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;htmx.org@1.8.2&#x2F;dist&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unpkg.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;preact@10.11.2&#x2F;dist&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unpkg.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;preact@10.11.2&#x2F;dist&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;preactjs.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;v10&#x2F;getting-started#no-build-tools-route" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;preactjs.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;v10&#x2F;getting-started#no-build-tool...</a><br>

<br>Show HN: America – Road Trip Simulator

<br><p>APIs are a little like the open road—always waiting, full of opportunity, but hardly utilized. So here’s America, composed of several APIs that paint a vivid, real-time picture of a good old-fashioned road trip. Get local classifieds and photos. Tune into local radio stations. Talk wit other drivers.  And more.<p>Exploring the country by car was an invaluable experience for me during my time in the states. I’ve since moved to Barcelona, and find myself missing the territory. This is my attempt at recreating the magic.</p>

This is evocative and beautiful. Thank you for building this. As an implant in the US (25 years and counting), I was and still am awestruck at the variety the country offers in scenery, conversations, music and food.<p>I started driving all around the country when Rand McNally maps were the source, and visits to AAA for Triptychs, and Motel 8 for 20$ a night was life-altering for this 25-year old newbie. Not to mention the $10 Geo Metro car rental and 99cents gallon of Petrol (~3.75ltrs).<p>Now sitting in a fancy part of the country, where Burgers sell for $20, it is a sucker punch to read this Craig&#x27;s List posting:<p>Darling Nigerian Dwarf Buckling Goat
This little guy is a doll with a sweet disposition. Pretty tricolor with frosted ears. If you want to add a sire to your herd, a sweet pet or both, he&#x27;ll fill the bill. His dam is one of my milk goats. Will band upon payment if desired. Current on CDT and has had first trim. Located north of Franklin NE.<p>Thank you again.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
Some feature requests:<p>* Show number of users connected<p>* Incorporate real weather, easy to get an API key for free like I did at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;weather.baby&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;weather.baby&#x2F;</a><p>* Not sure if the Camera Roll is automatically scrolling for me, most of the roads look the same in Kansas or something<p>* I&#x27;m sure this has been suggested but: Mute the radio when talking<p>* Show other users on the map<p>* Light&#x2F;Dark mode during day&#x2F;night<p>Love it!<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
I have no real comment on the site, but just some awesome coincidence. I&#x27;m currently on the west coast in a hotel room watching a Nebraska football game on the television. I pull this site up and it puts me in Smith County, Kansas. I turn on the radio and it pulls up the local AM radio call from Superior Nebraska of the exact same game I&#x27;m watching on TV. Awesome.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
My wife and I have driven all over the eastern seaboard, to the west coast, the southern tip of Texas, and to Alaska. Would love to retrace some of these routes on a bicycle one day.<p>We’ve traveled to many places in the world, and there are of course countless great people and sights, but all that really helped provide perspective  on just how much we have available to us just in North America: Canada, the US and Mexico contain an incredibly diverse set of landscapes and cultures.<p>Whenever we go on trips, we will pick a song and listen to it over and over, and then when we hear it later, it helps the memories come back. One of the songs we’ve used is, aptly, America by Simon and Garfunkel.<p>There are a bunch of books about hitchhiking across America. We have hitched a few rides ourselves. We picked up one called The Last American Hitchhiker by Mark Kneeskern, that we read aloud to each other during journeys. Fascinating vignettes of the culture across the continent.<p>Thanks for the fun game and for bringing back some memories.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
Love it. As a EU, always dreamed about listening to real country music. In the car in Nebraska, its even better. Suggestions:<p>1. Optionnally display other&#x27;s cars<p>2. Mute radio when talkie talkie<p>3. Display talkie radius if any<p>4. Some way to regroup (im not sure)<p>5. Apk that continues in background<p>6. Some way to make&#x2F;add plugins<p>It&#x27;s wonderful as it is. Thanks for making this.<br>

<br>Google engineers joked about how incognito mode isn't incognito

I&#x27;m quite familiar with this whole lawsuit, and I still think it&#x27;s total and complete bullshit (and, to be clear, I have <i>huge</i> concerns about Google&#x27;s tracking and surveillance).<p>Incognito Mode basically puts you in a mode as if you had installed a fresh, new instance of the browser every time, e.g. none of your past cookies can be accessed by any websites. Websites, though, can still use analytics APIs, including things like Google Analytics, to track you <i>within that Incognito Mode session</i>. They may also be able to correlate you by, for example, matching your IP address. And, to be clear, the Incognito Mode new window has always made this clear.<p>I can still be really concerned about Google&#x27;s overall tracking and also point out this lawsuit is a bullshit money grab from lawyers hoping for a lotto payout.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
A lot of folks are commenting on the fact that &quot;incognito mode&quot; never promised that it would conceal your identity.<p>I find it odd that everyone seems to be just ignoring that the word &quot;incognito&quot; literally means &quot;with one&#x27;s true identity concealed&quot;.   It is, in fact, reasonable for naive users to expect that their identity would be concealed while using &quot;incognito mode&quot;, Google&#x27;s disclaimers to the contrary notwithstanding.<p>&quot;What?  Everyone should have known that we didn&#x27;t literally mean &#x27;incognito&#x27;!&quot;<p>Luckily, every company&#x27;s engineers can be counted on to point out the irony of the company&#x27;s marketing bullshit.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
I recently published a Chrome extension that lets you configure different proxy settings for regular&#x2F;incognito tabs, after seeing that this was deemed &quot;not a supported feature&quot;, thread locked:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;chrome&#x2F;a&#x2F;thread&#x2F;143076679&#x2F;proxy-settings-for-chrome-incognito-mode" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;chrome&#x2F;a&#x2F;thread&#x2F;143076679&#x2F;proxy-s...</a><p>The extension makes it possible to use a SOCKS5 proxy (ideally tunneled over WireGuard) for incognito tabs, without affecting normal tabs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pmarks-net&#x2F;incognito-proxy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pmarks-net&#x2F;incognito-proxy</a><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
It is funny, marketers often get a bad reputation for being unethical or intentionally misleading, but I would say, more often than not, if you look behind the curtain at a company you would see similar emails from marketing asking for something to be changed or updated because they are uncomfortable with the way they are being asked to position a product.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
On android when you open an incognito tab it very clearly says that this mode will not store browsing history, cookies or form data.<p>And does &quot;nothing&quot; to stop ISPs or websites tracking you.<p>Not sure how anyone can misunderstanding what data is or is not saved when it&#x27;s stated on every new incognito tab.<br>
